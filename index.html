                    <h2>Video Games</h2>
                    <p>My number one favorite thing to do would most likely be playing video games. Some of the closest friends I have are with me now
                       because of video games. I like how you can find an amazing story, hear some amazing music, and have fun in one single experience.
                       I've been playing video games since I was little and I watched my dad played game on the Sega Genesis and later on the Playstation.
                       Games are the main reason I got into programming, my goal is to be able to work on a game that everyone loves and makes people happy.

                    <h2>Music</h2>
                    <p>
                        I love music, there's just something about a good song or soundtrack and makes me happy and I dont know what it is. I have some instruments 
                        at home that I like to play like: My guitar, my ukelele, my keyboard, and my recorder. I want to learn more instruments and learn actual music 
                        theory to improve my skills to the point where I can tell someone I play music without having to worry about being embarrassed when I take out 
                        an instrument. I love playing and listening to music but I don't want to do it as a career, I want to play music because I want to be
                        able to play songs and riffs from my favorite games and make people happy with it, not for money or anything.

                    <h2>Video Editing</h2>
                    <p>
                        The only other thing I really do is edit videos and then post them on youtube. Editing videos is fun, it allows me to express a bit of my 
                        creativity while not having to start from scratch. There's still a bunch of stuff I don't know about editing and I'm also terrible at it but 
                        I still like to do it and show it to my friends, hearing that they like it or hearing them laugh at it really brings me joy. I do wish I was 
                        better at editing and that more people would watch my videos but I'm just happy that my friends like it, nothing else really matters.
                    </p>
